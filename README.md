I did Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis on the Market Forecast Dataset and did the Following :
✔ Cleans the dataset (handles missing values, removes duplicates)
✔ Feature Engineering (Moving Averages, Lag Features, Date-Based Features)
✔ Removes Outliers (Z-score filtering)
✔ Visualizes Trends (Commodity Price Trends, Correlation Heatmap)
✔ Saves Processed Data for Forecasting
